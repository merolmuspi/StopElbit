    <h1>Framed as “industrial cooperation” or “security partnerships,” integration of Israeli military technology into European defence infrastructures is getting deeper</h1>

    <p>
        Several European NATO countries have ordered hundreds of loitering munitions—often described as suicide drones—through a partnership between the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall and the Israeli company UVision. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in early 2026.
    </p>

    <p>
        The systems, marketed under the HERO family of loitering munitions, are produced in Europe by Rheinmetall’s subsidiary RWM Italia, while the weapons technology and munitions are supplied by UVision, an Israeli drone manufacturer. The partnership between the two companies was formalised in 2021, with Rheinmetall leading industrial production and commercial operations in Europe, and UVision providing Israeli-developed systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        UVision promotes these drones as “combat-proven”. This battlefield "validation" is directly linked to genocide in Gaza, crimes in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran, as israeli weapons manufactrers produly claim (UVID 2025 Drone Tech Conference).
